## My process
I complete the solution to the challenge using HTML and CSS, it was initial hard to decode for me majorly when I need the style the QR code using margin or padding to position the image in the div, I use only one div for all the solution, and include the font(Outfit) by adding the link to the google font so that any browser can easily download the font fron font.google.com.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

When creating the solution to this challenge I find out more practical difference between using a margin and padding to position your element in a div, also the different between using a font size in the body and in a paragraph


### Continued development

on the use of margin and padding.
